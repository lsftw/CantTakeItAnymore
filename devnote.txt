===== current task =====
Defeat without taking damage:
hunter
- defeated with every ship so far
warlord
- defeated with every ship so far
warlord supreme
-

good coding techniques

add shok levels
finish saboteur
finish scout

zone simulator

===== ===== =====

what is convention for what goes into preDt(), postDt()? Note this somewhere.

===== ===== =====

--- caller ---
gun.fire()

--- backend ---
'data/enemy/warlord.txt'
Warlord
fires WarlordMissile
at offset (sx/2 - 10, sy)
every 4/5 of a second

WarlordMissile
dmg 50
vy 18

--- notes ---
WarlordSupreme, being a subclass of Warlord,
will automatically inherit Warlord's gun

===== later cleanup =====

abstract ai patterns, ex: firing projectiles, multi fire

===== to fix (bugs) =====
- FPS increase has jumps, FPS drop has freezes [performance]
- FPS display inaccurate [aesthetic]
- more accurate explosion damage calculation for large enemies [gameplay]

===== to do (core) =====
- powerups & special abilities [gameplay]
- high scores [gameplay]

===== to add (improve) =====
- separate key handling from draw/dt thread [performance]
- adjust hud to base off of settings file and scale [aesthetic]
- tips per zone, zone types and tips per zone type [gameplay]
- work for different font sizes [aesthetic]
- music and sound [aesthetic]
- some better way to do countdowns and countups [coding]
- balance the three ships [gameplay]
- don't draw out of range [performance]

===== to consider (longterm) =====
- unique message display object for each zone object? [coding]
- make enemies always spawn at ypos = -ysize and remove option to choose y position [coding]
- make enemy adding easier [coding]
- get flipping to work for tiling (esp. for mulis beam) [aesthetic]
- explosions or fragments when ship destroyed [aesthetic]
- generic system for enemy projectile firing to facilitate modification [coding]
- allow spaces in file names (note: class names cannot have whitespace) [coding]

conventions:
warning = can recover with negligible impact to functionality
error = can't recover / will notably impact functionality
var = -0; // var's value will be initialized before use, only initializing to remove errors/warnings


===== Attributes =====
fast = speed x2, maxspd x2, score x1.5
slow = speed x.5, maxspd x.5, score x.5
superslow = speed x.1, maxspd x.1, score x.1

durable = health x2, score x1.5
weak = health x.5, score x.5

huge = size x3, health x3, maxspd=3, score x2.5
spawned = scorex0

offsets
fighter sx = 30; sy = 30;
guardian sx = 40; sy = 27;
warlord sx = 86; sy = 90;
protector sx = 43; sy = 23;

===== Design =====
Flyer (visible object on screen)
Being (flyer with health & image)
Player (being with advanced controls)

3 Powerups
Refinement - Increased damage
Focusing - Better single-target performance
- Better multiple-target performance

Elavian: The Warrior/Knight
BOOST = collecting destroyed flyer debris slowly repairs hull
- slow firing, slow moving, explosive rocket
- able to charge, moving forwards quickly, taking less damage and dealing more damage through collisions
* Refinement: Volatile Payload (rockets are larger, deal more damage, create larger more damaging explosions)
* Focusing: Hyper Missile (increased rocket speed, rockets move very quickly for first few seconds after fire, explosion size/damage increases with rocket speed)
* : Homing Missile (rockets move quickly and home on nearby targets)

Kohsair: The Ranger/Acrobat
BOOST = maneuvers can be performed with horizontal movement
- rapid fire, rapid speed bullets, perhaps bullets fired at various angles
- maneuver while firing to deal more damage
* Refinement: Bullet Wave (max bullet angle increased, increased bullet fire rate)
* Focusing: Chemical Assault (increased bullet damage, bullets have piercing attribute when doppler shotting, small explosive attribute when bullet raining)
* :

Mulis: The Magician/Wizard
BOOST = ?
- near instant fire and speed lasers, undodgeable
- able to absorb projectiles using barrier, empowering lasers upon absorption
* Refinement: Focusing Beam (lasers get stronger while focused on one enemy)
* Focusing: Disintegrator (lasers also deal % cur hp damage)
* : Particle Accelerator (lasers spew erratic spirals of particles)




2 levels per stage
Level 1 - simple level & boss
Level 2 - difficult level & super boss

Stages 1-3: The Primary Aspects

VALE: warlord
fighter (charge attack!)
guardian (durable, fires arcing orbs to left and right)
protector (turns invincible shortly after being hit, shoots fire)
post-vale (after boss defeated): health doubled
.
Warlord [v], fast moving with quick powerful missiles: Summons no-score weak fast Fighters, gets faster over time
super: faster, summons three times as many fighters, fires triple missiles

SHOK: hunter
scout (curved movement, chases player, fires forward, fragile)
saboteur (cloaks to dodge projectiles, destroys projectiles, fires many powerful bullets)
sentinel (strafes and dodges projectiles, fires bullets towards player)
post-shok (after boss defeated): speed +1
.
TODO: Hunter [s], fires a disabling bullet that slows ships down then unleashes a barrage of bullets, tries to evade projectile fire: increases in power over time
super: occasionally dashes sideways, fires twice as often

ILUM: aeromancer
adept (charges and fires angled waves of energy)
morpher (becomes larger and smaller, fires beams that scale with size)
medium (channels to put barriers on allies that block some damage and increase collision damage, has passive damaging aura)
post-ilum (after boss defeated): ability cooldown greatly reduced
.
TODO: Aeromancer [i], wind slows projectiles near it, projectiles come from sides of the screen, fires wild moving twisters: Abilities are used more often as time progresses
super: uses two abilities at a time
