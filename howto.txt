===== How-to Modify Flying People =====

+++ Adding a new Enemy +++
1) Create a subclass of Enemy in the flyingpeople.flyer.enemy package
2) Implement resetStats(), including health, scoreValue, and initial velocity (usually vy > 0)
optional: if you want to add projectile firing, look at Guardian's code as a template
- for projectile firing, you want to make sure the spawned projectile doesn't collide with the Enemy
optional: if you want to add flyer spawning, look at Warlord's code as a template
- make sure the flyers spawned have "spawned" attribute to avoid score farming
- make sure the flyers do not collide / friendly fire on the spawner
optional: if you want to display different frames of the enemy sprite, override getFrameToDraw()
3) Add an entry to spritelist.txt, with the enemy sprite located in res/enemy

4) Add an enum constant to EventType (typically just the classname in all caps)
5) Add a case with that enum to Level's trigger(LevelEvent)'s switch

Note: Projectile offsets are manually inputted for sprites

+++ Adding a new level +++
1) Create an ASCII text file in data/level
2) Add the name of the level file into levellist.txt
